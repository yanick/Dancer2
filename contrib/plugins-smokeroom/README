How to smoke Dancer's plugins (Yanick style)

1. Create a Pinto repo on your machine

2. Get the list of Dancer plugins found on CPAN

    $ sqlite3 ~/.cpan/cpandb.sql 'select dist_name from dists \
        where dist_name like "Dancer-Plugin%"' \
        | perl -pe's/-/::/g' > plugins.list

3. Pull'em all in pinto

    $ perl -ne'chomp; next if /^\s*#/; `pinto -v pull $_`' plugins.list

Mind you, the command could have been as simple as

    $ pinto -v pull < plugins

but for two things: I wanted to be able to comment out problematic plugins in 
the list and skip over them, and it seems that Pinto would abort commiting 
all of the pulled distributions if one of them goes wrong.

4. test'em

    $ ./test_plugins.pl < plugins.list

5. report the result

    $ ./report.pl
